faq:
  - question: Why NicE ?
    answer: >-
      Since my early college years, my account id was **nendredi** but one day,
      when I tried to use it on a website login (don't remember wich) that id
      was not avaible so I added a few letter of my first name et voil√† ! It's
      only a few hours later that I saw you can divide it into **Nice** and
      **ndredi** (which kinda sounds like *and ready* or *and dready* don't you
      think ?
